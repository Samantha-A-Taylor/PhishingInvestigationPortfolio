# Phishing Analyses
***
## Project Overview ☰
This project documents a series of hands-on phishing email and phishing URL investigations completed as SOC analyst practice through LetsDefend's simulated alert environment. Each write-up follows a full investigation workflow, from initial triage through evidence gathering, verdict determination, and closure reasoning, for alerts involving malicious attachments, malicious links, and internal email traffic. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a repeatable, evidence-based approach to phishing triage: identifying red flags, validating indicators of compromise (IOCs) through independent third-party sandboxes, tracing delivery paths through log data, and confirming (or ruling out) execution on the destination endpoint.

## Key Features 🔑
       ✓ Initial email triage to identify red flags in headers, sender addresses, subject lines, and message body language
       ✓ Sender and destination domain reputation/health checks (SPF, DKIM, blacklist status, mail server configuration issues)
       ✓ Malicious attachment analysis across file types, including zip archives, Excel (.xls/.xlsx) documents, and DLLs, 
          including Excel 4.0 macro–based malware
       ✓ Malicious URL analysis, including sandbox detonation and multi-vendor threat scoring
       ✓ Log management to trace email/request delivery paths between source and destination addresses
       ✓ Endpoint investigation to confirm or rule out execution, using process and terminal history review
       ✓ True positive / false positive determination with documented, evidence-based closure reasoning
