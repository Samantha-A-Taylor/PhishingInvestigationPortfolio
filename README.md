# SOC Phishing Investigation Portfolio
***
## Project Overview ☰
This project documents a series of hands-on phishing email and phishing URL investigations completed as SOC analyst practice through LetsDefend's simulated alert environment. Each write-up follows a full investigation workflow, from initial triage through evidence gathering, verdict determination, and closure reasoning, for alerts involving malicious attachments, malicious links, and internal email traffic. **The goal of this project is to demonstrate a repeatable, evidence-based approach to phishing triage:** identifying red flags, validating indicators of compromise (IOCs) through independent third-party sandboxes, tracing delivery paths through log data, and confirming (or ruling out) execution on the destination endpoint.

| Alert | Severity | Verdict | Key Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phishing URL Detected | High | True Positive | Malicious domain flagged by VirusTotal & HybridAnalysis; endpoint history showed remote script execution |
| Suspicious Task Scheduler | Medium | True Positive | Malicious attachment flagged by VirusTotal & HybridAnalysis; email blocked before delivery, no endpoint execution |
| Internal to Internal | Medium | False Positive | No attachment, link, or call-to-action; benign internal correspondence |
| Malicious Attachment Detected | High | True Positive | Malicious Excel dropper flagged by VirusTotal, HybridAnalysis & Filescan.io; EXCEL.EXE execution confirmed on endpoint |
| Excel 4.0 Macros | High | True Positive | All 3 attachment files flagged malicious by HybridAnalysis; DLL registration confirmed via regsvr32.exe on endpoint |
| Phishing Email Challenge | N/A | True Positive | Malicious URL flagged by VirusTotal; PayPal-themed financial lure with non-English body text |

## Key Features 🔑
       ✓ Initial email triage to identify red flags in headers, sender addresses, subject lines, and message body language
       ✓ Sender and destination domain reputation/health checks (SPF, DKIM, blacklist status, mail server configuration issues)
       ✓ Malicious attachment analysis across file types, including zip archives, Excel (.xls/.xlsx) documents, and DLLs, 
          including Excel 4.0 macro–based malware
       ✓ Malicious URL analysis, including sandbox detonation and multi-vendor threat scoring
       ✓ Log management to trace email/request delivery paths between source and destination addresses
       ✓ Endpoint investigation to confirm or rule out execution, using process and terminal history review
       ✓ True positive / false positive determination with documented, evidence-based closure reasoning

## Technologies Used 🛠️
